        "content": "<p>At the Post we make a lot of great interactive graphics. Most of these are built as static html pages. It\u2019s a great way for our incredibly talented graphics team to work. They have flexibility to design and build the approach that is best for telling the story.<\/p>\n<p>There is a drawback to this approach &#8211; it makes it difficult to work with content from our CMS. Our reporters and photographer\u2019s workflow is built around having their work printed in the paper and displayed on <a href=\"https:\/\/washingtonpost.com\">washingtonpost.com<\/a> both of which are powered by a CMS. At the Post as we evolve how we tell stories online our interactive graphics must be integrated with great writing and awesome photography. How can we do that without making our graphics team hack a template to death or inject raw code into the CMS? Gulp provides an answer.<\/p>\n<h2>Gulp Glue<\/h2>\n<p>On our recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/graphics\/world\/exodus\/black-route\/\">Black Route project<\/a> we tried a new approach that allowed our reporters and copy editors to work on the article and the graphics team to build interactive features without breaking either team\u2019s workflow.<\/p>\n<p>We use Gulp on the graphics team for our build tasks &#8211; SASS compilation, JavaScript modules etc. We really like the speed and flexibility it provides. And in this case it was the glue we could use to stick our graphics work together with the article being written in our CMS.<\/p>\n<p>So beyond our normal build tasks we came up with an approach to combine our interactive graphics being developed by the graphics editors with the article being written by the reporters. What we needed was a way to target different parts of the article with interactive graphics in a way that was familiar for our graphics editors. We came up with what we called the article transform, which along with a few other Gulp tasks allowed us to take interactive graphics, photos and an article stored in a CMS and combine them into a single HTML file which we could then publish online. Lets dive into the article transforms and other tasks in detail.<\/p>\n<h2>Article Transforms<\/h2>\n<p>The article transformation is the most interesting and important part of what we had Gulp do on this project. What if you could write jQuery selectors for where you wanted your HTML graphics inserted into article content and get the result as static html at the end? This is what the transformations allowed.<\/p>\n<p>Each transformation was stored as a file in a directory. The selector location and the transform was specified as front matter and the HTML injection we wanted applied was the body of the file like this:<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"xml\">\r\n\u2014\r\nselector: \u2018article\u2019\r\naction: \u2018prepend\u2019\r\n\u2014\r\n&lt;div class=\u201cwrap\u2014right wrap\u2014map\u201d&gt;&lt;figure class=\u201clocator-map map\u201d id=\u201cfollow-locator\u201d&gt;&lt;\/figure&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n<\/code>\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Our Gulp task runs through a directory of these files and saves them in memory:<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\r\nvar memory = []; \/\/array of files contents etc... \r\n\r\ngulp.task('load-insertions', function() {\r\n  \/\/setup the objects we need... \r\n  memory = [];\r\n  return gulp.src(config.injections_src)\r\n  .pipe(frontMatter({ \r\n      property: 'fm',\r\n      remove: true \r\n    })) \r\n  \t\/\/ tap into the stream to get each file's data\r\n  .pipe( tap(function(file) {\r\n  \tconsole.log('Loading Injections: ' + path.basename(file.path));\r\n  \tvar newinsertion = {};\r\n  \tfor(var i in file.fm){\r\n  \t\tnewinsertion[i] = file.fm[i];\r\n  \t}\r\n    newinsertion.content = file.contents.toString();\r\n\r\n    memory.push(newinsertion);\r\n\r\n  }));\r\n});\r\n<\/code>\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Now that we have all the transforms in memory we can download the article and apply them.<\/p>\n<h2>Download and transform<\/h2>\n<p>We have an internal JSON api for all stories in the CMS. Using <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Metrime\/gulp-download\">gulp-download<\/a> we would pull down the story, turn it into a JS object using gulp-json-transform and pull out the article html content. Then we parse that using <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/KenPowers\/gulp-cheerio\">Cheerio<\/a> and apply our injections.<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\r\ngulp.task('download-transform', ['load-insertions'], function () {\r\n    return download(config.src_url)\r\n    \t\t.pipe(jsonTransform(function(data) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/we only need the html node from story adapter\r\n\t\t\t        return data.html;\r\n\t\t    }))\r\n\t\t    .pipe(cheerio(function ($, file) {\r\n\r\n\t\t    \tvar $paragraphs = $('p'); \/\/get all the paragraphs\r\n\r\n\t\t    \tfor(var i=0; i&lt; memory.length; i++){\r\n\t    \t\t\tvar insertion = memory[i];\r\n\t\t    \t\tif(insertion['offset'] &amp;&amp; insertion['selector'] == 'p'){\r\n\t\t    \t\t\t$paragraphs.eq(insertion['offset'])[insertion['action']](insertion['content']);\r\n\t\t    \t\t}else{\r\n\t\t    \t\t\t$(insertion['selector'])[insertion['action']](insertion['content']);\r\n\t\t    \t\t}\r\n\t\t    \t}\r\n                    }))\r\n\t\t\t.pipe(rename(config.file_name))\r\n        \t.pipe(gulp.dest(config.dest));\r\n});\r\n<\/code>\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Note that this task uses the injections stored in memory by the previous task and runs that previous task as a dependancy. This approach was inspired by this <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/gulpjs\/gulp\/blob\/master\/docs\/recipes\/make-stream-from-buffer.md\">Gulp recipe<\/a>. We kept the configuration in the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/lmtm\/gulp-front-matter\">front matter<\/a> where the injections were specified so the task wouldn\u2019t have to be constantly updated &#8211; even as the article or injection changed. The huge upside of doing it this way is the syntax for the injections is ultra familiar: it\u2019s just jQuery. And because we can use any css selectors we want even as the reporters change the content it won\u2019t break the interactive graphics that are being built.<\/p>\n<h2>All together<\/h2>\n<p>So in the end our complete article transformation pipeline performs the following tasks:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Load into memory article transforms that will apply graphics specific markup to the article<\/li>\n<li>Download the article from the JSON api endpoint<\/li>\n<li>Parse the html from the downloaded article using cheerio<\/li>\n<li>Apply those transforms to the parsed html<\/li>\n<li>Inject the transformed article html into the graphics template<\/li>\n<li>Save the file and serve it locally (ready for production)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably even clearer as a picture:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/platform-wp-demo-elb-1950808061.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Blog-diagram.001.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-63\" src=\"http:\/\/platform-wp-demo-elb-1950808061.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Blog-diagram.001-196x300.jpg\" alt=\"Blog-diagram.001\" width=\"196\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Connected Newsroom<\/h2>\n<p>Being able to connect Gulp tasks like legos allows us take things we are familiar with &#8211; our normal build system and javascript &#8211; and extend them to make functional, cross-newsroom workflows.

In 1918, he joined Dunsterforce and served in the Caucasus Campaign, during which he was instrumental in protecting thousands of Assyrian refugees.

After the war he played a key role in the establishment of Legacy Australia, the war widows and orphans benefit fund.<\/p>\n<p>During the early years of the Second World War, Savige commanded the 17th Infantry Brigade in the North African Campaign, the Battle of Greece and Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign.
